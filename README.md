# angular-2-learning

Instructions:

Install Node.js --> https://nodejs.org/en/
Install npm (via link above)

Clone the repo and run "npm install" from the root folder.

When browser sync does not work (on mac): sudo npm install browser-sync gulp --save-dev

When this is done: "npm start" (calls gulp dev task) which runs browserSync and immediately updates the browser.
